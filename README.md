# week4challenge

## What was the challenge?

To write a play book that Write installs Docker onto the local machine

## How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to be relatively better than the last 3 weeks as I have a better understanding of navigating the systems and was able to use the resources provided by QA community and on the web to guide me through the challenge

## What went well?

The resources guided and this enabled me completed the challenge

## What didn't go as planned?
I was unable to push to git hub using the command git push -u origin master, also tried main but non worked

## Possible improvements for future challenges.
To keep studying, practising so I can continue to improve my knowledge on all that I have been taught at the academy
